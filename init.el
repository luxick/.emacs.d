;; init.el -- Patrick Thomson's emacs config. -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This file is in the public domain.
;;
;; If you want to give this file a try, you can just drop it into
;; ~/.emacs.d: it downloads everything it needs. It is also relatively
;; fast to start up (once it's downloaded all the required packages),
;; as it endeavours to load packages lazily when possible.
;;
;; A general note on keybindings: the custom keybindings applicable to
;; all major modes appear with the C-c prefix, as is standard.
;; Per-language commands appear with the C-c a prefix. The most
;; important keybinding, C-;, provides counsel-M-x, which lets you
;; fuzzy-find through the space of available functions. Exploring
;; counsel-M-x is the best way to become familiar with the space of
;; extensible functions, which is a sine qua non for being comfortable
;; with Emacs.
